This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict vehicle COâ‚‚ emissions based on fuel consumption and engine characteristics. The analysis will help regulators, manufacturers, and consumers understand the environmental impact of different vehicles and make more sustainable choices.
This project aims to analyze sales data for seasonal products at XYZ Retail Inc., to predict inventory needs for the upcoming season. The results will help in optimizing inventory levels, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction.
